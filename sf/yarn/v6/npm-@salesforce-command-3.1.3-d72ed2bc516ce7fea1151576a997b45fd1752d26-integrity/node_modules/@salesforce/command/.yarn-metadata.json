Extend this class for convenient access to common Salesforce CLI parameters, a logger, CLI output formatting, scratch orgs, and Dev Hubs.

To check your Salesforce CLI version:\n\n```bash\n$ sfdx version\nsfdx-cli/6.42.0-ae478b3cb8 (darwin-x64) node-v8.9.4\n```\n\n### Features\n\nTo learn more about the features of the Command Library see the _[Salesforce CLI Plug-In Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_plugins.meta/sfdx_cli_plugins/cli_plugins.htm)_.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are interested in contributing, please take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli-packages/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.\n\n## Development\n\nIf you are interested in building this package locally, please take a look at the [DEVELOPING](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli-packages/blob/develop/DEVELOPING.md) doc.\n\n## Related Docs and Repositories\n\n- [@salesforce/command](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli-packages/tree/master/packages/command) - Contains the base Salesforce CLI command, `SfdxCommand`.\n- [@oclif/command](https://github.com/oclif/command) - Contains the base oclif `Command`, which `SfdxCommand` extends.\n- [@salesforce/plugin-generator](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-plugin-generate) - The generator plug-in for building plug-ins for Salesforce CLI.\n",
