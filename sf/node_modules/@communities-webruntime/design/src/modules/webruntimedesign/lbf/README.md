# README

## Why do we have these minified files?

These files are built artifacts from https://git.soma.salesforce.com/BuilderFramework/builder-framework.

`interactions.js`: https://git.soma.salesforce.com/BuilderFramework/builder-framework/tree/master/packages/%40lbf/interactions

`utils.js`: https://git.soma.salesforce.com/BuilderFramework/builder-framework/tree/master/packages/%40lbf/utils

## Which version of @lbf are we pulling in?

[v0.2.46](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/BuilderFramework/builder-framework/releases/tag/v0.2.46)

## When are we getting rid of them?

See https://git.soma.salesforce.com/BuilderFramework/builder-framework/issues/413 for details.

tl;dr, we will be able to get rid of them when either:

-   `@lbf` publishes `@lbf/interactions` and `@lbf/utils` to the public npm registry, or
-   `yarn` fixes `https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6526`
