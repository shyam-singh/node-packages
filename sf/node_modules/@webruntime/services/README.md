# Lightning Web Runtime :: Services

This package contains core [Addressable Services](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/communities/webruntime/packages/@webruntime/api/docs/classes/_services_addressable_service_.addressableservice.md) provided by LWR.

### Importmap Service

The core Importmap Service is responsible for providing an addressable importmap resource (compliant with [WICG import-map specification](https://wicg.github.io/import-maps/)) in the format expected by the [client loader](../loader/README.md).

### Component Service

The core Component Service is responsible for providing compiled Lightning Web Components and modules that are made available in the `moduleDir` as well as modules installed in node_modules as referenced by the `lwc.config.json`.

### App Bootstrap Service

The core App Bootstrap Service handles the specialized `@webruntime/app` component, which is a virtual component generated by the service to handle the bootstrapping of your application component into the [Custom Element Registry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry).
